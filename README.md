# ElectricityUsageVsTemperature
This is a repository for my analysis of my electricity usage in 2021 against the temperature in my area.

A full write-up can be found at my website: https://www.brysko.com/portfolio

Temperature Data is sourced from Weather Underground (https://www.wunderground.com)
Electric Data is my own, based on billing information provided by Tampa Electric.
